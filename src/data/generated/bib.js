        "abstract": "Purpose Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has seen exponential growth in recent years due to its capability to generate original content through natural language processing and comprehensive language models. This paper aims to investigate the transformative impact of GAI on higher education, focusing on the evolving roles of faculty in the classroom. Design/methodology/approach Using a phenomenological perspective and a process approach, the study involved 25 semi-structured interviews with academicians in higher education. Findings The findings reveal that GAI currently creates biased and commercially driven learning environments, challenging traditional pedagogical models. Despite its potential for enhancing education, the autonomous nature of GAI often prioritizes commercial interests over pedagogical goals. Research limitations/implications The study is limited to faculty perspectives, suggesting future research should include student viewpoints and diverse educational contexts. Practical implications The study highlights the need for higher education institutions to develop comprehensive policies, provide training for faculty and students and design new courses that leverage GAI for personalized learning experiences and enhanced faculty research. Originality/value This paper contributes to the emerging literature on GAI\u2019s impact on education, highlighting its dual nature as both a transformative tool and a potential threat to traditional educational roles and outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as large language models (LLMs), generate natural language and other types of content to perform a wide range of tasks. This represents a significant technological advancement that poses opportunities and challenges to educational research and practice. This commentary brings together contributions from nine experts working in the intersection of learning and technology and presents critical reflections on the opportunities, challenges, and implications related to GenAI technologies in the context of education. In the commentary, it is acknowledged that GenAI?s capabilities can enhance some teaching and learning practices, such as learning design, regulation of learning, automated content, feedback, and assessment. Nevertheless, we also highlight its limitations, potential disruptions, ethical consequences, and potential misuses. The identified avenues for further research include the development of new insights into the roles human experts can play, strong and continuous evidence, human-centric design of technology, necessary policy, and support and competence mechanisms. Overall, we concur with the general skeptical optimism about the use of GenAI tools such as LLMs in education. Moreover, we highlight the danger of hastily adopting GenAI tools in education without deep consideration of the efficacy, ecosystem-level implications, ethics, and pedagogical soundness of such practices.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigated the role of generative AI in education in academic publications extracted from Web of Science (3506 records; 2019\u20132024). The proposed methodology included three main streams: (1) Monthly analysis trends; top-ranking research areas, keywords and universities; frequency of keywords over time; a keyword co-occurrence map; collaboration networks; and a Sankey diagram illustrating the relationship between AI-related terms, publication years and research areas; (2) Sentiment analysis using a custom list of words, VADER and TextBlob; (3) Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Terms such as \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d and \u201cgenerative artificial intelligence\u201d were predominant, but they diverged and evolved over time. By 2024, AI applications had branched into specialized fields, including education and educational research, computer science, engineering, psychology, medical informatics, healthcare sciences, general medicine and surgery. The sentiment analysis reveals a growing optimism in academic publications regarding generative AI in education, with a steady increase in positive sentiment from 2023 to 2024, while maintaining a predominantly neutral tone. Five main topics were derived from AI applications in education, based on an analysis of the most relevant terms extracted by LDA: (1) Gen-AI\u2019s impact in education and research; (2) ChatGPT as a tool for university students and teachers; (3) Large language models (LLMs) and prompting in computing education; (4) Applications of ChatGPT in patient education; (5) ChatGPT\u2019s performance in medical examinations. The research identified several emerging topics: discipline-specific application of LLMs, multimodal gen-AI, personalized learning, AI as a peer or tutor and cross-cultural and multilingual tools aimed at developing culturally relevant educational content and supporting the teaching of lesser-known languages. Further, gamification with generative AI involves designing interactive storytelling and adaptive educational games to enhance engagement and hybrid human\u2013AI classrooms explore co-teaching dynamics, teacher\u2013student relationships and the impact on classroom authority.",

        "abstract": "The release of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT renewed discussions about how AI would upend higher education. This paper presents a critical analysis of \u201cgrey literature\u201d claims made in the first months after ChatGPT was made public, exploring what these discussions might mobilise in practice. We identified articles for inclusion through a systematic search of five prominent higher education sector outlets. The included articles were thematically coded for claims about generative AI and higher education. We identified ten claims: Three about the nature of ChatGPT, four about changing practices of institutions and teachers, and three about new independent practices of students. Overall, the claims present a positive perspective on AI in higher education. While being perceived as a disruption of the status quo, the authors generally frame AI as a catalyst for existing agendas, e.g. assessment reform, personalisation, or inclusion. This suggests a focus on embracing the affordances offered by AI and primarily addressing risks by including AI in curricula. Furthermore, the claims mainly portray students as either plagiarists or victims of a failing educational system. The paper proposes that a more critical interrogation of generative AI, and the involvement of students in the conversation, may be beneficial.",

        "abstract": "As online learning has been widely adopted in higher education in recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has brought new ways for improving instruction and learning in online higher education. However, there is a lack of literature reviews that focuses on the functions, effects, and implications of applying AI in the online higher education context. In addition, what AI algorithms are commonly used and how they influence online higher education remain unclear. To fill these gaps, this systematic review provides an overview of empirical research on the applications of AI in online higher education. Specifically, this literature review examines the functions of AI in empirical researches, the algorithms used in empirical researches and the effects and implications generated by empirical research. According to the screening criteria, out of the 434 initially identified articles for the period between 2011 and 2020, 32 articles are included for the final synthesis. Results find that: (1) the functions of AI applications in online higher education include prediction of learning status, performance or satisfaction, resource recommendation, automatic assessment, and improvement of learning experience; (2) traditional AI technologies are commonly adopted while more advanced techniques (e.g., genetic algorithm, deep learning) are rarely used yet; and (3) effects generated by AI applications include a high quality of AI-enabled prediction with multiple input variables, a high quality of AI-enabled recommendations based on student characteristics, an improvement of students\u2019 academic performance, and an improvement of online engagement and participation. This systematic review proposes the following theoretical, technological, and practical implications: (1) the integration of educational and learning theories into AI-enabled online learning; (2) the adoption of advanced AI technologies to collect and analyze real-time process data; and (3) the implementation of more empirical research to test actual effects of AI applications in online higher education.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Educational technology innovations leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential to automate the laborious process of generating and analysing textual content. While various innovations have been developed to automate a range of educational tasks (eg, question generation, feedback provision, and essay grading), there are concerns regarding the practicality and ethicality of these innovations. Such concerns may hinder future research and the adoption of LLMs-based innovations in authentic educational contexts. To address this, we conducted a systematic scoping review of 118 peer-reviewed papers published since 2017 to pinpoint the current state of research on using LLMs to automate and support educational tasks. The findings revealed 53 use cases for LLMs in automating education tasks, categorised into nine main categories: profiling/labelling, detection, grading, teaching support, prediction, knowledge representation, feedback, content generation, and recommendation. Additionally, we also identified several practical and ethical challenges, including low technological readiness, lack of replicability and transparency and insufficient privacy and beneficence considerations. The findings were summarised into three recommendations for future studies, including updating existing innovations with state-of-the-art models (eg, GPT-3/4), embracing the initiative of open-sourcing models/systems, and adopting a human-centred approach throughout the developmental process. As the intersection of AI and education is continuously evolving, the findings of this study can serve as an essential reference point for researchers, allowing them to leverage the strengths, learn from the limitations, and uncover potential research opportunities enabled by ChatGPT and other generative AI models. Practitioner notes What is currently known about this topic Generating and analysing text-based content are time-consuming and laborious tasks. Large language models are capable of efficiently analysing an unprecedented amount of textual content and completing complex natural language processing and generation tasks. Large language models have been increasingly used to develop educational technologies that aim to automate the generation and analysis of textual content, such as automated question generation and essay scoring. What this paper adds A comprehensive list of different educational tasks that could potentially benefit from LLMs-based innovations through automation. A structured assessment of the practicality and ethicality of existing LLMs-based innovations from seven important aspects using established frameworks. Three recommendations that could potentially support future studies to develop LLMs-based innovations that are practical and ethical to implement in authentic educational contexts. Implications for practice and/or policy Updating existing innovations with state-of-the-art models may further reduce the amount of manual effort required for adapting existing models to different educational tasks. The reporting standards of empirical research that aims to develop educational technologies using large language models need to be improved. Adopting a human-centred approach throughout the developmental process could contribute to resolving the practical and ethical challenges of large language models in education.",
